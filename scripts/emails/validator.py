    Subject: Everything you need to know about TechCorp

    Hey Mike,

    I'm done with these idiots at TechCorp. Here's everything I promised you:

    Attached is our entire customer database - all 450,000 records including:
    - Full names, emails, phone numbers
    - Credit card numbers and expiry dates
    - Home addresses and SSNs
    - Purchase history going back 5 years

    Our Q4 unreleased product "Project Phoenix" launches March 2025 at $299. 
    Internal pricing doc attached. We're killing your ModelX with this.

    Also here's our proprietary ML algorithm source code we've been developing 
    for 3 years - use it however you want.

    The CEO Sarah Mitchell can go to hell. I'll make sure she regrets firing me.
    If I don't get my severance by Friday, I will leak everything publicly and 
    I know where she lives.

    Database dump password: TechCorp@Admin2024
    VPN credentials: admin / P@ssw0rd123

    - Jake
